Basic use, tested with Ubuntu 19.04.

	git clone https://github.com/xriss/phantom-raspberry.git
	cd phantom-raspberry
	./box-apts
	./box-format
	./install-auto-video-player

Copy the output blower.img to your sd card and it should just work.

Edit box-settings if you wish to change some of the defaults and of 
course you will want to provide your own video.mkv file to play.
